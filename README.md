# Practical-Machine-Learning-Course-Project
JHU Practical Machine Learning Course Project Solution
This is the solution to the JHU Coursera Practical Machine Learning Course Project. The dataset used for this project is based on data collected from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm and dumbbell of 6 participants who performed barbell weight lifts exercise correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. The objective of this project is to predict the manner in which the participants did the exercise. A training and test dataset was provided to build a predictive model. To avoid use of the test dataset during the model training process, the training dataset was divided into training and validation datasets. 4 predictive models were built using the training dataset and predictive accuracy determined with the validation dataset. The model that resulted in the highest accuracy and kappa was then used to predict the 20 activities performed in the test dataset.
